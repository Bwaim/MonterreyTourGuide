    <string name="cultureTitle1">Metropolitan Cathedral</string>
    <string name="cultureSummary1">This temple located in the old neighborhood of Monterrey is the seat of the Archdiocese of the city. Account with a tower of three bodies and a sober central ship, with hornacinas chapels in the sides and a cupola of octagonal form. The construction dates from the 18th century, although it mixes neoclassical lines with a baroque façade. The chapel of the tabernacle has a beautiful frontal of embossed silver. In the sacristy there is a series of beautiful paintings from the viceregal period and in the presbytery there are colorful murals by Ángel Zárraga Arguelles, painted during the 1940s.</string>
